# Deploying a little Web-App in Heroku, with Flask - SQlite - JS
> by Franklin Gonzales
## Introduction

Next, I will deploy a Web application, created in Javascript, with queries to the SQLite database from python. In the part of the Back-end, we will have a Flask server. The application, in its entirety, will be transferred to Heroku to deploy on its servers. 
Let us begin!

## Road Map

We have the following 3 big steps:

* Create a virtual environment.
* Create the necessary files to perform the deploy.
* Perform the deploy in Heroku.
